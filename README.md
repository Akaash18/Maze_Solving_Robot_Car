ESP32 Line-Following Robot with Path Optimization
An autonomous maze-solving robot powered by an ESP32, featuring:

**8-IR Sensor PID Control** for accurate line tracking

**PWM Motor Control** via H-bridge driver

**EEPROM Path Storage** to save movement sequences

**Path Optimization** to eliminate redundant turns

**Bluetooth (SerialBT)** for debugging and monitoring

Dual Modes:

**Learning Mode:** Records turns (L/R/U-turn)

**Execution Mode:** Follows optimized path

**Encoder Feedback** for precise turning

Supports left-hand/right-hand course strategies

The robot learns, stores, optimizes, and efficiently replays navigation paths.
